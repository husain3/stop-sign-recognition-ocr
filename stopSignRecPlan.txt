- Inside While Loop
	1. Extracts bigframe from video camera
	2. Converts color image into HSV scheme
	3. Mask with upper/lower red shade bounds (to find red blobs)
		a. Needs improving
			aa. for dynamic lighting conditions
				aa1. need to adjust exposure
				aa2. need to adapt to different warmths? (maybe?)
	4. Find contours and save them (with their positions)
	5. Extract areas with contours and increase size for each of them
		a. Needs improving
			aa. Needs a fine morphOps function (look at morphOps function from tutorial)
	6. Convert found areas to binary black and white images (and enhance..before or after conversion?)
	7. Run Tessaract for OCR



- Current Problems
	a. How to do depth perception to know if we're approaching a stop sign?
		aa. Maybe get the general distance and read the vehicle speed (OBD2) and 		alert if too fast before getting to stop sign?
		bb. Or have two lines going straight ahead and if stop sign gets closer 		to the bottom of the line at high rate of speed, sound the alarm.
			bb1. Assumes stop sign will pass at the side of the frame.
	b. After stop sign found, do we still need to run an algorithm to search for red 	blobs of a full picture or search general area where stop sign found?
